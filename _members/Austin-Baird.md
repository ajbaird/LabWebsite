Iâ€™m an applied mathematician with experience leading teams, collaborating with clinicians and academic institutions, and solving hard problems in biology and medicine. I have worked on multiple large open-source projects consisting of whole-body physiology modeling, burn care training, and traumatic brain injury protein simulations, all funded through the department of defense.  

I received my PhD from [UNC Chapel Hill](https://math.unc.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Laura Miller](https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/person/laura-miller) where my research focused on fluid-structure interaction in cardiovascular applications. From there I performed my postdoc working with [Dr. Anita Layton](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/people-profiles/anita-layton-0) at [Duke University](https://math.duke.edu/) where i researched mathematical models in renal physiology. At the University of Washington, I am Research Assistant Professor working towards expanding advanced physiological modeling. My research focuses on mathematical modeling of biological systems, specifically, mathematical models in human physiology as it related to trauma, and dynamical system applications as they relate to uncertainty and data driven models. My experience includes being the PI on the Virtual Patient (BurnCare) project, and the BioGears primary and follow-on efforts.
