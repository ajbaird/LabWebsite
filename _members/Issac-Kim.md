Izzyâ€™s research at the Baird Lab (in coordination with the Cardiac Systems Simulation (CardSS) Lab) focuses on using computational science to investigate cardiac arrhythmias. Her work, particularly on atrial fibrillation (AFib), leverages patient data to create personalized simulation studies aimed at bridging the healthcare gap for vulnerable populations.
