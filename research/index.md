We consider the physiological state of the patient in response to trauma. The ultimate goal of our work is to create a **validated whole-body physiological digital twin of a patient + injury profile**. Once constructed we want to ask questions about treatment protocols, intervention timing and cohort studies of in-silico clinical trials. In addition, we aim to provide the most well-validated computational model of the patient for robust, dynamic, high-fidelity healthcare simulation training.
