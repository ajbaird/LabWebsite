We aim to develop sophisticated open source resources with all the research we perform. In addition, to these resources we are also managing the new [Division of Healthcare Simulation Sciences](https://uwsurgery.org/divisions/healthcare-simulation-science/) [GitHub](https://github.com/DivisionofHealthcareSimulationSciences) where we aim to publish and provide resources to support the development of cutting edge simulation technologies.
