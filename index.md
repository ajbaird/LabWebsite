# Mathematical Models of the Human Physiological Response to Trauma

Located in the [Division of Healthcare Simulation Sciences](https://uwsurgery.org/divisions/healthcare-simulation-science/) at the [University of Washington's](https://www.washington.edu/) [Department of Surgery](https://uwsurgery.org/), our lab aims to leverage a variety of mathematical modeling techniques to simulate the physiological response to trauma and resuscitation. Specifically we aim to positively impact patient health by creating meaningful frameworks that can be leveraged to create high fidelity healthcare simulations to improve care provider training.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Computational models that we develop include deterministic and stochastic differential equations, physics-based cardiopulmonary models, and mechanistic models of system, tissue and molecular responses. Our work includes creating finished simulation products that can be leveraged by care providers in the classroom.

We aim to couple these modeling techniques to computational design and architectures that are flexible, dynamic, and reactive with [robust APIs](https://github.com/BioGearsEngine/core) in order to deploy them in a variety of training, research, and educational applications. This includes integration of models in [physical](https://crest.washington.edu/news/2021/6/3/surgical-simulator-advances-trauma-training-for-teams) (such as real-time robotics) and [virtual](https://bmcemergmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12873-020-00378-z) (such as augmented and [virtual reality displays](https://www.xcdsystem.com/iitsec/proceedings/index.cfm?Year=2020&AbID=79208&CID=572#View)) systems.

We always try and provide an inclusive environment that [meets everyone where they are](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html?ez_vid=2cae626a2fe896279da43d587baa3eb663083817). The work we perform is, by definition, multidisciplinary, spanning clinical expertise, mathematical formulation, engineering, and computer science.
